# Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Stanford University)

Undoubtedly one of the most popular courses on Coursera a.t.m. I briefly looked at the week 5 programming assignment for 'back propagation' as one of my students was facing some difficulty in solving it. 

I will be adding hints and/or solutions for the popular Coursera course for Machine learning as per request from some of my students.

Note: please use this solution only as reference - after you have tried the problems yourself. Honor system applies, would be happy to assist and/or answer any questions.

Apologies in advance for the coarse/untidy code at places - fair portions of it was written aboard Via rail and airport lounges :).
